This is a totally unsupported bunch of hacked together code I wrote a
long time ago. It's a mercurial based anti-wiki written in python
based on suckless.org's diri. 

it is written in 186 lines of python + some config and template files. 


Please don't actually use this. I'm keeping it because it's a fun memory, not because it was ever a good idea.
